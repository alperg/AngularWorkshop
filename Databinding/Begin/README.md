# Angular Data Binding

This example provides a look at Angular data binding syntax in templates.

## Exercise 1

1. Open `src/app/app.component.ts`. Take note of the properties it provides.

2. Complete the TODO task shown in the file.

3. Open `src/app/app.component.html` and complete the TODO tasks.

5. You should see the selected character displayed in the page
   and should be able to click on a character in the list and see the
   selected character change.

## Bonus Exercise

1. Remove the code that defaults the selectedCharacter in the component

2. Notice how the selected character is no longer displayed in the running app. Make that DIV disappear if there is no selectedCharacter (hint: use *ngIf)
