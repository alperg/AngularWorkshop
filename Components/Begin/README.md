# Angular Components

This example walks you through the process of creating Angular Components
and adding them to a module.

## Exercise 1

1. Open `src/app/app.component.ts` and perform the TODO tasks in the file.

2. Open `src/app/child.component.ts` and perform the TODO tasks in the file.

3. Go back to `src/app/app.component.ts` and add the following tag into its template
   immediately after the existing <br /> tag:

   `<child-component></child-component>`

4. Open `src/app/app.module.ts` and perform the TODO tasks in the file.

5. Open `index.html` and note that `<app-root>` is defined in it.

6. Once you have the previous TODO tasks completed you should see the parent and child components displayed.
