# Angular Template Forms

This example provides a look at how Angular form templates can be used to capture data.

## Exercise 1

1. Open `src/app/shared/customer.ts`. Take note of the properties it provides since this object will be data bound to the form.

2. Open `src/app/templateForm/templateForm.component.ts`. Note that it exposes model and states properties that will be used in the form.

3. Open `src/app/templateForm/templateForm.component.html` and complete the TODO tasks to add form template functionality.

5. You should see data displayed in the form. Remove data from one of the form fields and a validation error message should display.
